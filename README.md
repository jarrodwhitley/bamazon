# Overview

This project was a opportunity for me to learn React/Redux coming from a Vue background.

## State
I'm currently working on core functionality (on feature/sql-db). Only basic layout/styling has been done. I'll revisit that once all features of the site are working as intended.

## Technology
This project was build with:
- React
- Redux
- TailwindCSS

### TODO:
- Hash url with selections (both filters and products)
- Swap over to better component structure
- Move inline Tailwind classes to SCSS files and @apply (to make code more readable)
- Decide on a color scheme and fix layout (not happy with it at the moment)
- Account page
