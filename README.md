## Overview

Bamazon is a demo e-commerce application designed as a learning project for building commerce functionality using React and Redux. It provides a frontend interface allowing users to browse, filter, and select products. Its primary focus is learning core functionalityâ€”youâ€™ll notice that layout and styling are basic, with improvements planned once all features are implemented.

## Features

- Browse a product catalog with filters  
- Product detail views  
- State management using Redux  
- Responsive layout styled with TailwindCSS  
- (Potential) Account page functionality  

---

## Tech Stack

- **React** â€“ Core component library  
- **Redux** â€“ State management system  
- **TailwindCSS** â€“ Utility-first styling framework  
- **Vite** â€“ Fast development and build tooling  
- **SCSS** + `@apply` support for Tailwind refactoring  
- ESLint, Prettier, PostCSS configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher recommended)  
- npm or yarn  

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jarrodwhitley/bamazon.git
   cd bamazon
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Running the App

Launch it locally:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will spin up a local development server (commonly at `localhost:3000` or `localhost:5173` depending on Vite configuration).

---

## Current Status & Roadmap

Currently, the app features core product browsing and filtering functionality.  
Planned improvements include account management and a refined frontend user experience.

---

## Future Plans (TODOs)

- Update URL hash to reflect filter and product selections  
- Refactor component structure for better modularity  
- Move inline Tailwind classes to SCSS with `@apply` for readability  
- Finalize color scheme and layout â€” current design is provisional  
- Implement account page with user-specific features  

---

## About & Background

This project began as a learning opportunity to transition from Vue to React/Redux development.  
It emphasizes understanding React and Redux principles, with future improvements aimed at polishing UI and expanding functionality.
