# Overview

This project was a opportunity for me to learn React/Redux coming from a Vue background.

## Technology
This project was build with:
- React
- Redux
- TailwindCSS

### TODO:
- Hash url with selections (both filters and products)
- Swap over to better component structure
- Move inline Tailwind classes to SCSS files and @apply (to make code more readable)
- Decide on a color scheme and fix layout (not happy with it at the moment)
- Account page
