# Overview

This project was a opportunity for me to learn React/Redux coming from a Vue background.

TODO:
- Hash url with selections (both filters and products)
- Swap over to better component structure
- Move inline Tailwind classes to SCSS files and @apply (to make code more readable)
- Get different pages set up for different view
- Decide on a color scheme and fix layout (not happy with it at the moment)
